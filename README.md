# Elevator_Simulator
The two main classes are Elevator and Simulation.

# Limitations:
This only runs in discrete time.
The elevator moves one floor per clock tick (if not opening doors).
The elevator has infinite capacity.
The simulation can be run in batch mode and not interactively using input from a promt.

I want to add more tests to the code.

# Assumptions:
Several assumptions are documented as comments in the code.
